### panel Q&A
* characteristics of great reports?
  * background of good, great hunters
  * know your audience and adjust
    * multiple versions as needed
    * be mindful of future audiences
    * avoid repeating work / missing your own history
  * make it better for future responders
* hunting program measurement: is not finding evil a bad outcome?
  * increased awareness of an area: did we increase our understanding / coverage (vs ATT&Ck)?
  * data was not available for hypotheses -> finding for later work
  * coverage & collection usage : trend(events per GiB/logs)
* what can the customer(BU) bring to help hunters?
  * Logs! Are the apps logging and are the logs collected (and where)
    * It's better than bad , it's good!" -Bojack Horseman
  * Crown jewels and critical processes to target, and the app owners of them
    * business priorities and worries, drivers
* does policy backing help hunting and IR results?
  * depends on policy enforcers, can help justify hunt program at C-levels
  * then it's difficult to change policies that impede progress
* traits of effective hunters (as in hiring)
  * excited and interested, self-motivated
  * "passion" (technical skills can be learned)
  * edges (depth) of knowledges and their understanding of them
    * take them down a rabbithole on purpose ...
    * get them to "I don't know" and hope for "I'll look it up" 
  * not never stops working: but "how do you keep up" / "home lab"
  * not looking for: skills I need for the team 
  * select for different skills and background to team
  * **not** work-aholic with no life, but enjoys the work
  * capacity for expertise combined with humility to work with other experts
  * approach and attitude likely > domain knowledge without them
* Gratitude from Phil to the team that put the summit together

**NB**: CTI Summit 2021 is virtual and the CFP is open! Jan 21, 2021 -Feb 1, 2021
